### Fonts for powerline
In order to display vim-airline correctly, powerline patched fonts need to be installed.\
`sudo apt install fonts-powerline` is not working as expect.

It is better download and install the font manually.
My fonts of choice are: \
* [Roboto Mono Medium](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/raw/master/RobotoMono/Roboto%20Mono%20Medium%20for%20Powerline.ttf).
* [Fira Mono Medium](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/raw/master/FiraMono/FuraMono-Medium%20Powerline.otf).
